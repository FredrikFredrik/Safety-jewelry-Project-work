# Safety-jewelry-Project-work


We have created an app that connects to a necklace by bluetooth.   
the necklace has a button which, when pressed, sends a signal to an app installed 
on the user's phone. The app will then interpret the signal and send a message to 
up to three contacts saved in the app. for now the text message is hard coded and cannot be 
changed. For test purposes we made a message in swedish which roughly translates to : 
HELP I am in a dangerous situation. Please call me!
